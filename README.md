# Competitions
Web platform focused on providing fast and easy way for people to participate in or organize new competitions. 

Small university project aiming towards adding SEO optimisation to an ASP.NET Core website. It's a primitive competitions website with no commercial use, it's more like social platform where people can create competitions (leagues/cup tournaments)  or participate in such. Each competition can have fee, prize and rules, all set by the organiser. Platform acts like a listing place where people can easily find past, ongoing and future competiitions.
